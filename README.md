!! ALL CREDITS GO TO THE ORIGINAL AND ACTIVE MAINTAINER OF PLATYNATOR ADDON !!

Original creator: [https://www.curseforge.com/members/plusmouse](https://www.curseforge.com/members/plusmouse)

Original addon: [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/platynator](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/platynator)

All credits go to him and his project, so I encourage you to please first go and check out Platynator before using my addon.

 

This is a clone of the Platynator addon that adds a Quest Tracking widget on top of the mobs' nameplates.

The most important change is that you can now find a new widged option "Quest Tracker" under "Text" category.

Besides the "Quest Objective" icon that the original addon supports, which just adds a "!" icon to mobs that are part of a quest, my addon adds new text around the mobs' nameplates (healthbars) that can help you track the progression of that related quest.

It takes the relevant information from the tooltip API for each unit. Works with kill/fetch quests and also with fill-the-bar quests, like:

*   1/7 Dragons captures
*   45% Assault completed

By default, it will display the first quest related to the unit for the current player.

But it can be configured, via a checkbox, to show all the quests related to a specific mod, if the mob is part of several quests:

Another important feature of the new widget is that it offers "Party support". For people playing/questing with friends, it can be sometimes difficult to know how they are doing without proper communication. With this party support feature, this information is at the glimpse of an eye:

Please note that party members are shown at the end of the quest progression text and are colored based on their class color.

These optiosn can be found in a dedicated tab in the widget's options:

Also, one more thing to mention here is that there is another option to remove the progression of other party members IF the progression is the same as yours. This was done in order to not pollute the UI with irrelevant information.

!! CLASSIC / ANNIVERSARY

Now, for you classic/anniversary enthusiasts, know that this also works in these versions, PROVIDED that you install a separate addon called Questie (which you probably already have) that adds quest information to tooltips. In case you don't, here's the link: [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie)

Here are some images on how the quest progression text looks like:

Also, in case you missed all this text, fear not, for a message in the widget settings will prompt you to install Questie

Some more considerations:

*   I will do my very best to keep the base code from the original addon in sync with this one
*   The settings you have on OG Platynator should be the same with this addon. It uses same settings table
*   It will not work to have both addons installed at the same time
*   Party Support only works for party groups and not for raid groups
